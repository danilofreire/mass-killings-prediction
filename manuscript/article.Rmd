abstract: "The literature on state-sponsored violence has grown significantly over the last decades. Although scholars have suggested a number of potential correlates of mass killings, it is unclear whether those factors increase our ability to forecast state-led violence. Here we employ ensemble learning algorithms to test the predictive performance of 40 variables on a sample of 177 countries from 1945 to 2013. We find that most variables fail to improve out-of-sample predictive power (*mention opportunity logic*). We also find high-order interactions between the covariates, which the existing literature generally does not account for. We argue that empirical studies on mass atrocities should adopt more flexible modelling techniques and use predictive accuracy to validate theories and inform public policy decisions."

# Introduction
\label{sec:intro}

Since the end of World War II, mass killings, genocides, and politicides have
claimed over 34.5 million lives [@marshall2017pitf].[^definition]
The international community has responded with an effort to prevent further
state-sponsored mass murder by strengthening laws against war crimes, genocide,
and crimes against humanity. Furthermore, the United Nations established a
Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide and recognised its members'
responsibility to protect civilian populations within and outside their own
borders. Yet, such atrocities still occur. Recently, President al-Assad of
Syria has massacred tens of thousands of civilians during the Syrian Civil War
[@goldman2017nyt]. Similarly, South Sudan's President Kiir is actively starving
and killing civilians from dissident and rival tribes [@nichols2017reuters].
While there is some evidence that such atrocities may be declining since the
Cold War [@valentino2014we], the international community has been far from
successful in realising slogans like "Never Again" and "Not on My Watch"
[@cheadle2007not].

[^definition]: Genocide and politicide are the attempted intentional
destruction of communal or political groups, respectively [see
@harff1988toward]. Mass killing includes these atrocities, as well as attacks
against civilians that result in at least 1,000 deaths but are not intended to
destroy a particular group [see @ulfelder2008assessing]. While some conflate
the logic of these types of atrocities [e.g., @rummel1995democracy;
@valentino2004draining], others claim genocide and politicide follow a
different logic from other forms of government violence [@kalyvas2006logic;
@stanton2015regulating]. For discussion on these important differences in
conceptualisation see @straus2007second and @finkel2012macro.

Ultimately, effective prevention requires us to understand why mass killings
occur. In this vein, the academic community suggests a myriad of factors that
correlate with government atrocity, from 


Scholars agree that government atrocity follows an opportunity logic: as
civilian threats against state leaders increase, so does the likelihood of
atrocity, if the costs to such violence are not prohibitive. However, the mass
violence literature points out a myriad of factors that correlate with 

In this vein, the academic community offers a myriad of explanations as to why
governments engage in brutality against civilians. 

Overall, the mass violence literature agrees that government atrocity follows
an opportunity logic: as civilian threats against state leaders increase, so
does the likelihood of atrocity, if the costs to such violence are not
prohibitive. 

But despite the recent growth of the literature on mass atrocities, existing
theories have not been followed by systematic evaluations of their relative
performance. Moreover, if the predictions the theories generate are unable to
explain future events, current findings offer little guidance to practitioners
and policy-makers. Identifying robust predictors of mass killings improves the
accuracy of early warning systems, which in turn leads to more effective
genocide-prevention strategies.

In this paper, we employ random forests, a machine learning algorithm, to test
the predictive ability of 40 variables identified as significant determinants
of mass killings. Although a small group of variables increase the predictive
accuracy of the models, most of them do not perform well in out-of-sample
forecasts. We find that economic variables are the most significant predictors
of state-sponsored violence, while political and demographic factors fare
poorly in our models (_rewrite_). When we assess the marginal effects of the
predictors, we also find that they are non-linear, showing high-order
interactions and complex prediction patterns. Our results indicate that the
literature on mass atrocities would benefit from focusing on a particular set
of structural factors and adopting more flexible modelling techniques.

We first present a brief overview of the recent scholarship on mass killings
and discuss its main findings. We then
